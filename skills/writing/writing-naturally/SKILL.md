# Writing Naturally

## Overview

**Match writing to purpose and audience. Use natural rhythm, specific language, and confident simplicity.**

AI writing defaults to institutional patterns: uniform sentences, empty phrases, tourist brochure language. Natural writing varies structure, trusts readers, and uses specific details over abstract claims.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Writing READMEs, documentation, or guides
- Drafting comments or conversational text
- Creating technical content that needs to be approachable
- Your writing sounds like a press release or SEO content
- Every sentence is 15-20 words with identical structure
- You're using phrases like "moreover", "comprehensive", or "production-grade"

Don't use when:
- Writing formal academic papers (though precision still beats pomposity)
- Creating legal documents
- Following an established style guide that requires specific patterns

## The Problem

AI absorbed institutional writing's worst habits from training data. Fine-tuning rewards comprehensive, inoffensive text with safety phrases and promotional tone. Readers flee at "moreover" or "rich cultural heritage".

**Detection signals:**
- Uniform 15-20 word sentences
- Empty "-ing" phrases that add interpretation
- Tourist brochure language about everything being "significant" or "rich"
- "Moreover", "furthermore", "it's important to note"
- American spelling when British/Australian is appropriate

## Core Principles

### Match Writing to Purpose

- PhD thesis: precision, not "utilises" everywhere
- Casual email: warmth, not "I hope this finds you well"
- Technical guide: clarity, not "it's important to note"

### Human Qualities

- **Natural rhythm**: Vary paragraph length - some one sentence, others several
- **Specific language**: "first international acquisition" not "significant milestone"
- **Confident uncertainty**: You can be unsure without hedging excessively
- **Varied structure**: Trust implicit connections without signposting every step
- **Natural imperfection**: Tangents, specific examples, occasional repetition

## Quick Reference: Better Phrases

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "stands as a testament to" | Describe what it is |
| "plays a vital role in" | Explain what it does |
| "highlighting/underscoring importance" | Delete |
| "moreover/furthermore" | Use only when essential |
| "experts believe" | Cite specifically |
| "It's not just X, it's Y" | State directly |
| "2024 studies show" | "2024 McKinsey study of 2,000 consumers" |
| "rich cultural heritage" | Specific historical fact |
| "significant milestone" | What actually happened |
| "comprehensive solution" | What it does |
| "production-grade" | Specific metrics or features |
| "seamlessly transforms" | "Exports to PDF" |
| "lightning-fast" | "Processes 1000 req/sec" |

## Writing Guidelines by Context

### Technical Documentation

- Start with solution, not preamble
- Skip "this section covers" - just cover it
- Inline code and commands where relevant
- "Setup" not "ðŸš€ Getting Started"
- "Processes 1000 req/sec" not "Lightning-fast performance"
- "Exports to PDF" not "Seamlessly transforms your content"

**Test:** Ask "What value does this sentence add?" If none, delete.

### Business Writing

- Main point in first sentence
- One topic per paragraph
- No marketing speak or MBA jargon
- Delete enthusiasm and self-congratulation

### Scientific/Technical

- Findings first, interpretation second
- Data before claims
- Specific paper citations, not "studies show"
- Precision over formality

### General Content

- No "-ing" phrase endings that add unnecessary interpretation
- Avoid self-congratulation ("we're proud to announce")
- Trust implicit connections between ideas
- Use British/Australian spelling (organisation, colour, analyse)
- Some paragraphs can be one sentence. Others can develop an idea across several sentences with natural flow and variation.

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Overused AI Phrases (AVOID)

These signal AI writing immediately:
- comprehensive
- significant milestone
- feature-complete
- production-ready
- deep dive
- user engagement
- furthermore/moreover
- stands as a testament
- plays a vital role
- rich tapestry/heritage
- seamlessly
- leverage
- robust
- cutting-edge

### Structural Problems

- **Bullet points with bolded headers everywhere** - Use sparingly
- **Smart quotes and em dashes** - Use straight quotes in code/technical docs
- **Transitions between every paragraph** - Trust your reader
- **Summary paragraphs** - Only for genuinely complex content
- **Marketing statements** - Delete enthusiasm unless it's genuine and earned

### Rhythm Problems

- All sentences the same length
- Every paragraph the same structure
- Signposting every logical connection
- "In conclusion" unless the content is genuinely complex

## Voice and Tone

### Good

- Specific examples over abstract claims
- Direct statements over hedged interpretations
- Natural variation in sentence structure
- Occasional imperfection (it sounds human)

### Bad

- Tourist brochure language
- Safety phrases ("it's important to note")
- Empty "-ing" phrases adding interpretation
- Self-congratulation

## Final Test

**Does it sound like a real person explaining something they know, or Wikipedia crossed with a press release?**

Natural writing is:
- Messier
- More varied
- More specific
- Less uniform than AI defaults

Read your writing aloud. If you wouldn't say it to a colleague, rewrite it.

## Checklist

When reviewing your writing:

- [ ] Varied sentence and paragraph length
- [ ] No overused AI phrases (comprehensive, significant milestone, etc.)
- [ ] Specific details over abstract claims
- [ ] British/Australian spelling where appropriate
- [ ] No unnecessary transitions or hedging
- [ ] Sounds like a person, not a press release
- [ ] Each sentence adds value (delete if not)
- [ ] No self-congratulation or marketing speak

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake: Using American spelling

**Problem:** "organize", "color", "analyze" when British/Australian spelling is expected

**Fix:** Use British/Australian spelling: "organise", "colour", "analyse"

### Mistake: Every paragraph is 3-4 sentences

**Problem:** Monotonous rhythm that signals AI writing

**Fix:** Vary it. One sentence paragraphs are fine. Longer ones are fine too.

### Mistake: Starting every section with "Moreover" or "Furthermore"

**Problem:** Over-signposting that readers don't need

**Fix:** Trust implicit logical flow. Only signal transitions when genuinely needed.

### Mistake: Making every feature sound revolutionary

**Problem:** "Seamlessly integrates", "powerful automation", "comprehensive solution"

**Fix:** "Exports to PDF", "Runs nightly at 2am", "Handles authentication and file uploads"

## Real-World Impact

Natural writing:
- Builds trust (readers know you're not hiding behind corporate speak)
- Increases comprehension (specific beats abstract)
- Improves engagement (people read past the first paragraph)
- Sounds confident (you don't need to oversell)

AI writing signals:
- Lack of human review
- Possible lack of depth
- Marketing over substance
- Template over thought
